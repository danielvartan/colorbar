## Overview

This repository contains a [NetLogo](https://www.netlogo.org) model that demonstrates how to create a simple color bar plot using the [`scale-color`](https://docs.netlogo.org/dictionary.html#scale-color) primitive.

At the moment, NetLogo does not have a built-in feature to create color bars. This model provides a workaround by drawing a color bar using temporary plot pens.

## How It Works

The color bar can be drawn in any plot using the `plot-color-bar` procedure. This procedure takes the plot name as an argument and creates a random color bar with 10 different colors. The implementation can be adapted to fulfill specific requirements.

```netlogo
to plot-color-bar [#plot-name]
  set-current-plot #plot-name
  clear-plot
  set-plot-x-range 0 1
  set-plot-y-range 0 1

  let #pens (range 1 11)
  let #pen-length length #pens
  let #pen-interval 1 / #pen-length
  let #colors n-values #pen-length [random-float 100]

  let #ranges map [
    #i -> (list ((#i - 1) / #pen-length) (#i / #pen-length))
  ] #pens

  let #step-size 0.01
  let #step-line 0

  (foreach #pens #colors #ranges [
    [#i #j #k] ->
      create-temporary-plot-pen (word #i "-bar")
      set-plot-pen-mode 1
      set-plot-pen-interval #pen-interval
      set-plot-pen-color #j
      plotxy (first #k)  1

      create-temporary-plot-pen (word #i "-line")
      set-plot-pen-mode 0
      set-plot-pen-interval #pen-interval
      set-plot-pen-color #j

      while [#step-line < 1] [
        plotxy (first #k) #step-line
        plotxy (last #k) #step-line

        set #step-line #step-line + #step-size
      ]

      set #step-line 0
  ])
end
```

## How to Use It

Ensure you have [NetLogo](https://www.netlogo.org) installed. This model was developed using NetLogo 7.0.0, so it is recommended to use this version or later.

Once everything is set, open the `colorbar.nlogox` file located in the `nlogox` folder and click on the *Plot Color Bar* button to visualize the color bar.
